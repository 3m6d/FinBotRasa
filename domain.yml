  utter_define_stock:
  - text: |
      Stock is a financial instrument that represents ownership in a company or corporation.
  - text: |
      When we talk about stocks or shares, we're discussing financial instruments that grant ownership in a corporation. Owning stock means having a claim on the company's assets and profits. The extent of ownership is determined by the number of shares you possess compared to the total shares issued. For example, if a company has one million shares and you own 100,000 of them, you hold a 10% stake in the company. 
  - text: |
      A stock, also referred to as a share or equity, represents a unit of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you are essentially purchasing a piece of that company and can claim a portion of its assets and profits. 
  - text: |
      A stock or share represents a financial claim to ownership in a company. When you buy stock, you are effectively purchasing a small part of that company, which entitles you to a claim on its assets and profits. If a company has one million shares outstanding and you own 100,000 of those shares, your ownership percentage is 10%. Stocks can vary greatly, with some companies having millions or billions of shares available.
  utter_ask_define_trading:

  utter_define_stock_market:
  - text: |

  utter_bottoming_out:

      Bottoming out is the phase when a stock falls downwards to its lowest peak and is expected to rise in the coming days. This phase seems
      profitable to investors as the stock is expected to rise rapidly.
